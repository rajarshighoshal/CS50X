1.  What’s stdint.h?
Ans. stdint.h is a header file that declares specified integer types as having a certain width.
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Ans. It makes clear that you intend to use the data a specific way. 
     uint32_t means an unsigned integer that is exactly 32 bits wide. Same is true for others.
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
Ans. BYTE is 1 byte.
	 DWORD is 4 bytes.
	 LONG is 4 bytes.
	 WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
Ans. The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. It must be
 	 set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
Ans. bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
     biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
Ans. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap) and
     its origin is the upper left corner.
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
Ans. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits
     that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
Ans. Machine is out of memory so it can't open the input file. Or, machine is unable to write the output file.
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Ans. Because it specifies how many elements you want to read, and we're always 
     reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
Ans. (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4 = (4 - 1) % 4 = 3
     So the value assigned to padding is 3.
11. What does fseek do?
Ans. Skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel (RGB triple).
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
Ans. This is an integer constant which, when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko 
     function, specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
